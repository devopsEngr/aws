CBA 2024 Interview 
Refractor Terraform code to host multiple websites with parent base domain under one account

Multiple api gateway for each project hosted in the account
 

Backup and Redirect website swipe a to swipe b


Manual backup of data - rds, s3, dynamo and cognito user pool
Redirect website using s3 and route53
 

ECS cluster images check coming from recent build or else the cluster loads the previous version

Terraform code optimized to handle this at deployment level by reading the ECR repo for the image version
This involved updateing ecr repo permissions to read image
 

Automated deployment in Terraform based on the commit and tag using TFC_CONFIGURATION_VERSION_GIT_TAG variable and regex pattern of the tag

RDS SSL certificate upgrade

AWS backup DRP

Backup and restore snapshot and continuous

 

Api gateway logs to be enabled from terraform

Null resource bug-> they have to be sequenced

 

Two way sms for communication module inbound outbound

Email receving notification should trigger the lambda subscription

 

 

 

Started with terraform cli moved terraform cloud

Questions:

1. Cloud native application api, trigger

Ans: I should have talked about the basics of the cloud architecture we have for Atribo - VPC, 2 subnets within itâ€¦ui components (apis) are in angular that are also running as service in ECS cluster, application microservices (as apis) in ECS cluster which is setup as EC2 type small medium large sizes.

RDS for SQL database and Dynamo for NoSQL DB

Initial Seeding users by creating username and password for each api by terraform logging in

There is a Lambda to add users to Database which reads the config from ParamStore
 

There is a ssm parameter


Keywords to use

Uderlying infra to run the application and its microservices

reusable, self-service platforms to increase software delivery.
